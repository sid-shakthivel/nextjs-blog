The next major feature a kernel needs after paging is of course multitasking. Multitasking can be quite complex to understand and implement; there is a lot of confusion over the difference between multithreading, multitasking, and multiprocessing - so we'll go over that first, then learn what about timers, a concept switch, and how to put it all together.

So to start, most computers have multiple cores, each core can run multiple processes, each process can have multiple threads. Multithreading is when you have parts inside the same program(task) that want to execute in parallel. Remember that this all runs on a single core - it can only do one thing at once. So what the computer does is swap between the threads so fast that it seems the computer is doing multiple things at once. Each thread has a certain time it can run before it is `preempted`. Remember since threads are in the same process they share files, network, and memory. Next is multiprocessing. A process is just the instance of a program which can be made from many threads. A good example would be chrome, and terminal. You can run these applications at the same time and for example write a blog article while downloading xcode 13. The kernel handles this in almost exactly the same way as how it handles multiple threads. Tasks are preempted and swapped so fast it seems that the computer is doing multiple things at once. Essentially your computer gives a slice of time to each process - note that programs which need the most time from the CPU recieve it so if you're editing a video, chrome might feel a bit slow. Multiprocessing is where it gets interesting - we have more than one CPU core which means we can actually do multiple things at the same time. So that's multitasking, multithreading, and multiprocessing in a nutshell. Hope you don' get too confused. Now for what a timer is.
